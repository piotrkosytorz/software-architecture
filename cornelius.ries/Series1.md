#### Test Quality
For test quality we count all the assert statements Test classes in the code.
After counting the assert statements we calculate the percentage based on the total number of units in the system.

For benchmarking the test quality we have used the following tresholds taken from \[3\]:

| rank | percentage |
|------|------------|
| ++   |   95-100%  |
| +    |   80-95%   |
| o    |   60-80%   |
| -    |   20-60%   |
| --   |   0-20%    |
