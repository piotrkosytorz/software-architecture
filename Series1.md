# Series 1

This documents contains our notes and answers to the questions about software metrics (practical lab Series 1).

## Relevant questions

The following are the questions stated in practical lab Series 1:

1. Which metrics are used?
1. How are these metrics computed?
1. How well do these metrics indicate what we really want to know about these systems and how can we judge that?
1. How can we improve any of the above?

## Answers

### Which metrics are used?

The following metrics were proposed: 

* Volume,
* Unit Size,
* Unit Complexity,
* Duplication.

SIG model metrics:

* Maintainability (overall),
* Analysability,
* Changeability,
* Testability.

### How are these metrics computed?

**TODO**: *Here comes the answer and link to code*

### How well do these metrics indicate what we really want to know about these systems and how can we judge that?

**TODO**: *Explain per metric and case, give examples.*

### How can we improve any of the above?

**TODO**: *Propose improvements, give examples.*
